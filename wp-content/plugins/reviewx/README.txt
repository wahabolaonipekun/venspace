== Description ==

Now you can add your authentic customer reviews on your WooCommerce store using the WooCommerce Review plugin - [ReviewX](https://reviewx.io/). It‚Äôs easy to set up and has an interactive dashboard that works seamlessly with any WooCommerce store and WordPress custom post type.

By using our plugin, you can create different multiple review criteria for your WooCommerce store product such as product quality, delivery time, service, product quality, etc. Based on these multiple review criteria, users can leave their ratings.
