Advanced Multi-criteria Rating & Reviews for WooCommerce. Turn your customer reviews into sales by collecting and leveraging reviews, ratings with multiple criteria.

== Description ==

Now you can add your authentic customer reviews on your WooCommerce store using the WooCommerce Review plugin - [ReviewX](https://reviewx.io/). It’s easy to set up and has an interactive dashboard that works seamlessly with any WooCommerce store and WordPress custom post type.

By using our plugin, you can create different multiple review criteria for your WooCommerce store product such as product quality, delivery time, service, product quality, etc. Based on these multiple review criteria, users can leave their ratings. Also, users can upload photos/videos in the review, recommend, like/dislike, share reviews through their social profiles, and more.

Well, you can set limited criteria for your product review (with the free version). But if you want to add more criteria, you need to purchase the premium version of the [ReviewX plugin](https://reviewx.io/docs/how-to-install-reviewx-pro/).

Now, let’s see a quick overview of our WooCommerce reviews plugin:
